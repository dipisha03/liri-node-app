LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

Created a command line node application, LIRI, that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

	my-tweets

		* will display the last 20 tweets from the twitter handle @LiRiNow03.

	spotify-this-song

		* If you add a song after you type spotify-this-song, then information about that song will populate.

	movie-this

		* If you add a movie title after they type movie-this information about that movie will populate.

	do-what-it-says

		* This will perform a random task pertaining to one that commands above.

Enjoy!
